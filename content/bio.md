My name is **Yiyang (Ian) Li**, a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. My advisor is [Prof. Yanfang (Fanny) Ye](http://yes-lab.org/). Before joining Notre Dame, I received my B.E. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Northeastern University (China) in 2024.

My research focuses on agentic AI systems and large foundation models, with the goal of enabling models to reason, act, and collaborate effectively in complex, real-world environments. I am particularly interested in **agent system optimization, retrieval-augmented generation and knowledge-guided reasoning, as well as efficient large foundation models.** For more details, please check my CV [here](/CV_YiyangLi.pdf).
